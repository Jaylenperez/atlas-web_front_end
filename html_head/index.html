        <h2>Why I Chose Atlas/Web Dev Spec</h2>
        <p>For a long time, I struggled to find a career path that I was passionate about. After high school, I attended community college to make my parents happy and followed my best friend into classes, unsure of what else to do. Sadly, I lost her in an accident that year, which left me feeling unmotivated and disconnected. I dropped out, started working as a server, and found some solace in the work. However, the long hours took a toll on me, and I realized I needed to prioritize my well-being. I decided to focus on my mental and physical health, reconnect with loved ones, and explore my interests. During this time, a family friend introduced me to Atlas (formerly Holberton) after hearing about a successful graduate who enjoyed the program. My boyfriend enrolled first, and I followed a few trimesters later. Though challenging, this experience has been incredibly rewarding, and Iâ€™ve discovered a newfound passion for programming that I never imagined I could achieve.</p>
